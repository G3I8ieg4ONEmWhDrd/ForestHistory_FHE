# ForestHistory_FHE

A privacy-preserving platform for analyzing historical deforestation and reforestation patterns using **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**. Researchers can perform encrypted computations on historical maps, satellite images, and geographic datasets without ever exposing sensitive data, enabling ethical and confidential environmental studies.

## Project Background

Studying long-term global forest changes is challenging due to privacy, sensitivity, and data confidentiality concerns:

* Historical maps and satellite imagery are often proprietary or sensitive
* Raw geographic data cannot be freely shared among international researchers
* Analyses on aggregated datasets can leak sensitive information about specific regions
* Ensuring ethical use of historical environmental data is critical

ForestHistory_FHE solves these issues by enabling encrypted analysis directly on confidential datasets:

* All input data (maps, images) is encrypted before computation
* Statistical and spatiotemporal analyses occur on encrypted data using FHE
* Researchers can obtain insights without ever accessing raw data
* Collaboration across institutions is safe, traceable, and privacy-preserving

## Features

### Core Analysis

* **Encrypted Data Import:** Load historical maps, satellite imagery, and geospatial datasets in encrypted form
* **Spatiotemporal Analysis:** Perform time-series and regional analysis on encrypted data
* **Forest Pattern Reconstruction:** Identify deforestation and reforestation trends across centuries
* **Region Aggregation:** Compute forest cover summaries without exposing exact coordinates
* **Ethical Reporting:** Generates aggregated insights suitable for publications without leaking sensitive data

### Data Privacy

* **Fully Homomorphic Encryption:** Enables computations on encrypted datasets, preserving confidentiality
* **Client-Side Encryption:** Researchers encrypt data before upload, maintaining local control
* **Immutable Logs:** All analyses and dataset access are tracked securely
* **Zero Knowledge Collaboration:** Multiple institutions can contribute data without revealing raw information

### Visualization & Interaction

* **Encrypted Maps Rendering:** Visualize results without decrypting sensitive datasets
* **Dynamic Time Filters:** Analyze forest changes over decades or centuries
* **Regional Dashboard:** Explore deforestation and reforestation metrics per region
* **Downloadable Encrypted Summaries:** Share analysis outputs without exposing raw input data

## Architecture

### Encrypted Computation Engine

* Performs statistical and machine learning computations directly on encrypted maps and satellite imagery
* Supports FHE operations for summation, averaging, classification, and trend detection
* Ensures all intermediate and final outputs remain encrypted until explicitly decrypted for authorized summaries

### Data Storage Layer

* Encrypted datasets are stored securely
* Metadata and analysis logs are tracked without revealing raw information
* Enables versioning of datasets and reproducibility of analyses

### Frontend Application

* **React + TypeScript:** Interactive visualization of encrypted analysis
